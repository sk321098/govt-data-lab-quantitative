I picked this dataset becuase education is a topic I am very interested in, and I have taken the SAT so it is interesting to see what other students from different backgrounds scored and how their backgrounds affected their scores. The types of information in the dataset made me wonder how my background might have factored into my score and where I would fit in the different columns. I picked two columns to study becuase I wanted to observe how wealth factored in to the students' performance on the test. I picked the loweset income group, 20-40k, and the highest income group, 80-100k, to see how both ends of the spectrum compared. I wanted to compare the most constrasting groups. I chose math as the test to study for no particular reason. I learned from my analysis that there was a sizeable difference between the math test scores of both groups. The mean for the 20-40k group was 500 while the mean for the 80-100k was 547. There was a difference of 47 points between the means of both groups. I can infer from the data that family income has an influence on SAT math test scores, with students from wealthier families on average scoring more than students from less wealthy families. I think it is very important to do research on why students from wealthier families are scoring more, and what can be done to decrease this disparity and level the playing field for all students.
